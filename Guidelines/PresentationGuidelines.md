# Presentation Guidelines

You are free to structure your presentations to your liking, but students tend to have success with the following format.

* Title Slide

  * Include the name of the project and group members.

* Motivation & Summary Slide

  * Define the core message or hypothesis of your project.

* Model Summary

  * Elaborate on the predictive model used, describing why it was the best choice for the data.

* Data Cleanup & Model Training

  * Describe the exploration and cleanup process.
  * Discuss any problems that arose with preparing the data or training the model that you didn't anticipate.
  * Discuss the overall training process and highlight anything of interest with the training process: Cloud resources used, training time required, issues with training.

* Model Evaluation

  * Discuss the techniques you used to evaluate the model performance.

* Discussion

  * Discuss your findings. Was the model sufficient for the predictive task? If not, why not? What inferences or general conclusions can you draw from your model performance?

* Postmortem

  * Discuss any difficulties that arose, and how you dealt with them.
  * Discuss any additional questions or problems that came up but you didn't have time to answer: What would you research next if you had two more weeks?

* Questions

  * Open-floor Q&A with the audience.
