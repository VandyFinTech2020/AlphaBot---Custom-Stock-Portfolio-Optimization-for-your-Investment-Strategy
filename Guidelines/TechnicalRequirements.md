# Technical Requirements

The technical requirements for Project 2 are as follows.

* [ ] Create a Jupyter Notebook, Google Colab Notebook, or Amazon SageMaker Notebook to prepare a training and testing dataset.

* [ ] Optionally, apply a dimensionality reduction technique to reduce the input features, or perform feature engineering to generate new features to train the model.

* [ ] Create one or more machine learning models.

* [ ] Fit the model(s) to the training data.

* [ ] Evaluate the trained model(s) using testing data. Include any calculations, metrics, or visualizations needed to evaluate the performance.

* [ ] Show the predictions using a sample of new data. Compare the predictions if more than one model is used.

* [ ] Save PNG images of your visualizations to distribute to the class and instructional team and for inclusion in your presentation and your repo's README.md file.

* [ ] Use one new machine learning library, machine learning model, or evaluation metric that hasn't been covered in class.

* [ ] Create a README.md in your repo with a write-up summarizing your project. Be sure to include any usage instructions to set up and use the model.
